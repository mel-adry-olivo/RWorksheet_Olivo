```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. 

It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

```{r}
matZero <- matrix(c(0,0,0,0,0), 5, 5)
vectorA <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

for (i in 1:length(vectorA)) {
  matZero[i, ] <- abs(vectorA - vectorA[i])
}
print(matZero)

```

2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
in Figure 2

```{r}
for(i in 1:5) {
  stars <- rep("*", i)
  print(stars)
}
```

3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.

```{r}

userInput <- as.integer(readline("Enter starting number for Fibonacci sequence: "))

if(is.na(userInput || userInput < 0)) {
  cat("Please enter something")
} else {
  x <- userInput
  y <- 0
  
  
cat("Fibonacci sequence starting from", userInput, ":\n")

repeat {
  
  next_num <- x + y
  
  if (next_num > 500){
    break
  }
  cat(next_num, " ")
  x <- y
  y <- next_num
  
}
}

```

4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

4a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? 
Show your codes and its result.

```{r}
prevData <- read.csv("householdData.csv")
head(prevData)
```

4b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in
Male? How about in Female? 
Write the R scripts and its output.

```{r}
males <- prevData[prevData$Gender == "M",]
males

females <- prevData[prevData$Gender == "F",]
females

numofMale <- nrow(males)
numofMale

numofFem <- nrow(females)
numofFem
```


4c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(),
chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. 
Write the R scripts and its result

```{r}

totalMaleFemale <- table(prevData$Gender)
plot(
    totalMaleFemale,
    main = "Number of Males and Females",
    xlab = "Gender",
    ylab = "Count",
    col = c("red", "blue"),
    legend.text = rownames(totalMaleFemale),
    beside = TRUE
    )
```

5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:

Food Electricity Savings Miscellaneous
60      10         5         25

5a. a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.

```{r}

spending_data <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"),
  Value = c(60, 10, 5, 25)
)

spending_data$Percentage <- spending_data$Value / sum(spending_data$Value) * 100

colors <- c("red", "blue", "green", "purple")

pie(spending_data$Value, 
    labels = paste(spending_data$Category,"(",spending_data$Percentage,"%)"),
    col = colors,
    main = "Monthly Income Spending of Dela Cruz Family")

legend("topright", spending_data$Category, fill = colors)

```

6. Use the iris dataset

```{r}
data(iris)
```

6a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you
have seen in the output.

```{r}
str(iris)

# The dataset is a collection of information about iris flowers. It has a collection of data of the length and width of the sepal and also the length and width of the petal for 150 different iris flowers. It also records the type of iris species to which each flower belongs. There are three species in the dataset: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
```

6b. b. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length, sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?

```{r}
meanOfFlowers <- colMeans(iris[,1:4])
meanOfFlowers
```

6c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write the R script and its result.

```{r}
species <- table(iris$Species)
nameOfSpecies <- c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica")

pie(species,
    labels = nameOfSpecies,
    col = c("red", "green", "blue"),
    main = "Species Distribution in Iris Dataset")

legend("topleft", legend = levels(iris$Species), fill = c("red", "green", "blue"),)
```

6d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts and show the last six (6) rows of each species.

```{r}
iris
subsetSetosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]
subsetSetosa

subsetVersicolor <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor",]
subsetVersicolor

subsetVirginica <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica",]
subsetVirginica

tail(subsetSetosa)
tail(subsetVersicolor)
tail(subsetVirginica)
```

6c. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal
width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on
the species.

```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width",
     main = "Iris Dataset", sub = "Sepal width and length",
     pch = as.numeric(iris$Species), col = as.numeric(iris$Species))

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species),
       pch = 1:3, col = 1:3,
       title = "Species")
```

6f. Interpret the result.

The scatterplot helps us see how iris flowers of different species differ in terms of sepal length and width.

The Setosa flowers typically have short sepal length and wide sepal width. They are grouped in the upper left part of the plot.

Versicolor flowers have average sepal length and width. They are in the middle part.

Virginica flowers are usually long in sepal length and have narrower sepal width. They form a group in the right part.

Based on the plot, it is easy to see the differences between the three iris species based on sepal length and width. 


7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black
Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White
Spot).

```{r}
library(readxl)
alexa_file <- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
alexa_file
```

7a. Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.

```{r}
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot", "BlackDot", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus", "BlackPlus", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Show", "BlackShow", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot", "BlackSpot", alexa_file$variation)

alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Dot", "WhiteDot", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Plus", "WhitePlus", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Show", "WhiteShow", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Spot", "WhiteSpot", alexa_file$variation)

alexa_file
```

7b.  Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the
object as variations.RData. Write the R scripts. What is its result?

```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")

variations_total <- alexa_file %>% 
  count(alexa_file$variation)

variations_total
save(variations_total, file = "variations.RData")
```

7c. From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.

```{r}

load("variations.RData")
variations_total
varNames <- variations_total$`alexa_file$variation`

totalPlot <- barplot(variations_total$n,
        names.arg = varNames,
        main = "Total number of each variations",
        xlab = "Name of Variations",
        ylab = "Total of each Variatons",
        col = 1:16,
        space = 0.1,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        las = 2)

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/worksheet#4/Worksheet4b/totalVars.png")
```

7d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by
side. Complete the details of the chart.

```{r}

blackVars <- variations_total[variations_total$`alexa_file$variation` %in% c("Black", "BlackPlus" , "BlackShow" ,"BlackSpot" , "BlackDot"), ]

whiteVars <- variations_total[variations_total$`alexa_file$variation` %in% c("White", "WhiteDot", "WhitePlus", "WhiteShow", "WhiteSpot"), ]

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
blackVars

blackPlot <- barplot(height = blackVars$n,
        names.arg = blackVars$`alexa_file$variation`,
        col = c("black"),
        main = "Black Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)


whitePlot <- barplot(height = whiteVars$n,
        names.arg = whiteVars$`alexa_file$variation`,
        col = c("white"),
        main = "White Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/worksheet#4/Worksheet4b/bwVars.png")
